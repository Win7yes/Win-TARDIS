#Win7's TARDIS Interior
This is my custom TARDIS Console Room for Dr. Matt's TARDIS Rewrite GMod addon.
It's in early development and I'm quite lazy soemtimes so it's kinda slow-progressing.
#Installation
You will need Dr. Matt's TARDIS Rewrite addon which can be found [here](https://github.com/MattJeanes/TARDIS/)

Either clone this repository with Git/Github Desktop in Your_Steam_Directory/SteamApps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons

Or click Download ZIP and extract Win7TARDIS-master in Your_Steam_Directory/SteamApps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons

To get rid of it simply delete the Win7TARDIS folder from your addons folder.
