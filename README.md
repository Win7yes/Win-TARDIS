#WIN's Model-3 TARDIS Desktop - For your Garry's Mod
Behold the third and (hopefully) final revision to my own TARDIS console room, the Win Model-3.
Now with 70% more space for hanging light bulbs from ropes!

The first model was never finished, and it was in general a big mess behind the scenes.
During 2017 I attempted to pick it back up, only to lose interest immediately afterwards, mostly because I didn't know what to make of it.

And in comes Model-3, the latest in the trilogy of "i'm bored ima make a tardis". 
Thankfully I've planned ahead for this one, so I'm not as in the dark as I was back then when it comes to what I want for my console room.

#Installation & Dependencies
This is a [TARDIS Rewrite](https://github.com/MattJeanes/TARDIS/) extension. It's required for this to function at all.

There are multiple ways to install this extension
You can:

Subscribe to the [Workshop version](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=576298727)

or

Clone this repository or download and extract the ZIP file, either way it must be placed under GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons/
If you're here I expect you know how to install a legacy addon. If you, however, don't, I recommend you subscribe to the workshop version instead.

Any issues related to this extension HAVE TO BE REPORTED HERE OR IN THE STEAM DISCUSSIONS. While it extends the rewrite, it's not a direct part of it.
